Use compojure to serve adhoc web resources quickly.

Useful for doing html/css/js development locally. Prevents problems caused when javascript may use AJAX to access resources.

## Usage

Install leiningen.

lein deps

lein ring server

## Roadmap

Add support for drop-in testing of AJAXy JS. Likely to include JSON support.
